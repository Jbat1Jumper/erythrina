## The size matters
```
One important thing is to have something for reference when drawing stuff. 
You do not want a knife to be of the size of a skyscreaper, 
or a whale of the size of a bean (except when that is the intention).
```
```
You shoud get some reference sizes to, for examle, 
make doors of the same size of the character. 
Make weapons so they look well near the character. 
And yes, you are right, the character is a very good 
reference to have at hand.
