# Drawing the environment

First, first of all. I lied. I've said that we will start with the code but. I just forgot that our Little Bald Boy is just floating in the void. So I've decided to draw a place to be for him and animate that environment.

This time I'll not be doing a tileset, instead of that I will draw everything in aseprite and then export the layers.

One important thing we need to know is the size. We have a very small sprite for Mr Little Bald, less than 16px. And we dont know where this is gonna be played. After some estimations based in the proportions of a squirrel I thought that 127h x 196w are good proportions. They are actually a little big but we have not to forget the gui.

So we start with a base image with a base color for a base sky.

Then we need to know what are we drawing. Because an image explain more than thousand pixels we draw a mockup of what are we doing in another layer.

There are things (I have to decide what are those things) that will fall from the sky and then there's a space for a menu on the left, a space for the meters on the right, and more space to fill up with drawings for now.

One important tip is to not lose the size reference. I've drawn a reference for the sprite in the mockup. We do not want to draw a car of the size of a building or a whale of the size of a bean, unless that is the point.

Actually I lied in the fact that I do not know what I'm drawing. I'm actually drawing whatever comes to my head while I'm writing this. So I search in my head and deep in my thoughts the only thing that I find is food. Yeah. I'm a very emotionally deep person.

Little Bald Boy is a hungry boy who wants to eat food, and then, suddenly, food falls from the sky. If there's no problem with Sony Pictures Animation for stealing their idea we can go on. There also will be bad things like radioactive waste barrels, knives, bones, and squirrels which will harm the player.

So we will picture that he is in a park. One important thing a park could need is grass.

It's not the best grass but it's a starting grass. But if we just cut the ground in half it hasn't grass everywhere. So we could add some dirt.

![](img/4/catchthethings04.png)

Also it's not the best dirt. To fix it, at least a little, we will add some pixel dithering, a darker dirt and more dithering.

What is dithering? When we do not have colors between two tones and we need to do a gradient effect we put some pixels of one color over the other color and vice versa. They may be randomly distributed or in a pattern. Hmmm, it doesn't sounds like a good explanation so an image will explain it better.

![](img/4/catchthethings05.png)

This may not be a good example because it's too small but the intention is there. I can't explain more because it come as a feeling, is like "OH! A pixel must go here" so may advise is, listen to your heart. :) 

After adding a darker shade of dirt and more dithering we end up with this.

I've also added a little dither on the dark shade of the grass.

Now we need to limit the player area with something. Let's draw a fence and a tree to fill the space on the left. 
 
Let's start with the fence. (Advise: Use layers. If you don't use them the sharks may come. A weekend someone could say "Hey, can you move that fence a little?" and you will have to redraw a lot just for that f#$%& fence.)

![](img/4/catchthethings07.png)

That's a nice basic fence but is a little monotone. Let's shade it.

![](img/4/catchthethings08.png)

Now to draw the tree. The tree will be behind the fence so we can just hide that layer and draw the tree (Also in another layer).


![](img/4/catchthethings09.png)

We draw a tree only in its base colors. It may look very bad but it's just the lack of shade what makes it look bad. So we shade it.

![](img/4/catchthethings10.png)

It is better now but we just marked the sites where we should add more shade. And because the tree is big, and because we love it, we will dither that shadow.

![](img/4/catchthethings11.png)

A whole way better. We just have to bring back the fence from the invisible void. And voil√†.	

![](img/4/catchthethings12.png)

Now we need to cover the right side of the park, or whatever. We will make a hotdog stand and some folks around. And a fat guy who will not let anyone pass.

Let's draw the stand.

![](img/4/catchthethings13.png)

Now it's a little too simple but it only needs shading. And some stripes, everybody loves stripes.

![](img/4/catchthethings14.png)

After that we only have to draw some guys in other layers. The seller is the same as the character but with different colors, but the fat one is just, fat, just more wider. And also he is eating a hotdog to, complete the picture.
